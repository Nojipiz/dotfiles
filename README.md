# :computer: Configuration Files
My dotfiles for linux based operating systems, this config don't chage so much of the default configuration in the software so it's nice to grab as a base.
- :mortar_board: Perfect to study due distraction free environment.
- :zap: Blazingly fast!, no Picom or Compton, runs as fast as possible.
- :battery: Battery friendly, without innecesary elements running in the background!


If you want to copy this, you must replace the "dot" keyword with an actual "." in the filename.
